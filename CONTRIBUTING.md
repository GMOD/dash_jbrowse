# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dash JBrowse. This short guide
will help you get started.

### Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/GMOD/dash_jbrowse
cd dash_jbrowse
yarn
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt #optional testing
python usage.py
```

Visit http://localhost:8050 in your web browser

This will start a flask server with a configured dash_jbrowse component. Check
out our [README](./README.md) for documentation.

### Install dependencies

1. Install npm packages
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```
2. Create a virtual env and activate (you can also use conda).

   ```
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install python packages required to build components.

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install -r tests/requirements.txt #optional testing
   ```

### Write your component code in `src/`.

- The demo app is in `src/demo` and you will import your example component code
  into your demo app.
- Test your code in a Python environment:
  1. Build your code
     ```
     $ npm run build
     ```
  2. Run and modify the `usage.py` sample dash app:
     ```
     $ python usage.py
     ```
- Write tests for your component.
  - A sample test is available in `tests/test_usage.py`, it will load `usage.py`
    and you can then automate interactions with selenium.
  - Run the tests with `$ pytest tests`.
  - The Dash team uses these types of integration tests extensively. Browse the
    Dash component code on GitHub for more examples of testing (e.g.
    https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components)
- Add custom styles to your component by putting your custom CSS files into your
  distribution folder (`dash_jbrowse`).
  - Make sure that they are referenced in `MANIFEST.in` so that they get
    properly included when you're ready to publish your component.
  - Make sure the stylesheets are added to the `_css_dist` dict in
    `dash_jbrowse/__init__.py` so dash will serve them automatically when the
    component suite is requested.
